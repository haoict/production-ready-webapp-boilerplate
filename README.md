## <a name='Motivation'></a>Motivation

When Create React App first launched in July of 2016, it was considered the best way for beginners to get started with React.
I find that it is too restrictive, and I find the ejection process to be painful, with resulting configuration being far to complex to easily tinker.
Also, Create React App and most other boilerplates you find on Github only offer client-side rendering.

Next.js is a minimalistic React framework that runs on the browser and the server. It offers developers an easy way to get started, and as it uses React.js for templating, its also a straightforward way for developers with React experience get started quickly.

The advantage of this approach is to be able to create rich user experiences in a uniform way, without compromising SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) factors that are key to good ranking on Google and other search engines.

This boilerplate makes it easier to get up and running with a well-structured Next.js.

Happy coding!
